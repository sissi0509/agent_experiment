# Lab 1: AI Fundamentals - Your First AI Journey

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

Making your first AI API call through 5 micro-tasks - each building on the previous one, like climbing stairs one step at a time.

### Your 5-Step Journey:

1. **Task 1**: Import the OpenAI library (2 lines)
2. **Task 2**: Initialize the client with credentials (2 lines)
3. **Task 3**: Make your first API call (3 lines)
4. **Task 4**: Extract the AI's response (1 line)
5. **Task 5**: Understand token costs (2 lines)

## 🚀 Before You Start

- You've never coded with AI before? **Perfect!** This lab is for absolute beginners.
- Each task is just 1-3 lines to fill in
- Complete them in order (1→2→3→4→5)
- Total time: ~15 minutes

## 📚 Key Concepts Explained Simply

### What is an API Call?

Think of it like ordering food at a restaurant:

1. You (your code) place an order (send a message)
2. The kitchen (OpenAI's servers) prepares your order
3. The waiter (API) brings you the food (AI's response)
4. You enjoy your meal (use the response in your app)

### What are Tokens?

- Tokens are like "word pieces" the AI uses to understand and create text
- Both your question and AI's answer use tokens
- More tokens = higher cost (like phone minutes)
- **Rule of thumb**: 1 token ≈ 4 characters or 0.75 words

### The Response Object

When you call the API, you get back a "package" containing:

- `choices[0].message.content` → The actual text response
- `usage.prompt_tokens` → Tokens in your question
- `usage.completion_tokens` → Tokens in AI's answer
- `usage.total_tokens` → Total tokens (what you pay for)

## 📁 Lab Files - 5 Progressive Tasks

## 🎮 How to Complete This Lab

### Step 1: Verify Your Environment

```bash
source /root/venv/bin/activate
python /root/code/verify_environment.py
```

### Step 2: Complete Each Task

Look for the `TODO` markers and fill in the `___` blanks:

```python
# TODO: Import OpenAI (Line 13)
import ___  # ← Replace ___ with: openai
```

Each TODO tells you EXACTLY what to type!

### Step 3: Run Your Code

Start with Task 1:

```bash
python /root/code/task_1_import_explained.py
```

Then continue with Tasks 2, 3, 4, and 5 in order.

### Step 4: Check Your Progress

Each successful task creates a marker file. You'll see:

```
✅ Congratulations! You made your first AI API call!
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

### For Task 1 (Imports):

- Line 13: `import openai`
- Line 14: `from openai import OpenAI`

### For Task 2 (Client):

- Line 16: `"OPENAI_API_KEY"`
- Line 17: `"OPENAI_API_BASE"`

### For Task 3 (API Call):

- Line 33: model = `"gpt-5.6-luna"`
- Line 36: role = `"user"`
- Line 37: content = `"Hello AI, please introduce yourself"`

### For Task 4 (Response):

- Line 56: `choices[0].message.content`
- This is THE path you'll always use!

### For Task 5 (Tokens):

- Line 50: `response.usage.prompt_tokens`
- Line 51: `response.usage.completion_tokens`

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: What if I get an error?**
A: Each TODO shows EXACTLY what to type. Copy it character-for-character!

**Q: Why 5 separate tasks instead of one big file?**
A: Breaking it down helps you understand each piece. Once you get it, you'll combine them all!

**Q: What's with all the underscores (\_\_\_)?**
A: They mark exactly where you need to fill in code. Replace them with the suggested values.

**Q: Can I skip ahead?**
A: Please don't! Each task builds on the previous one. Task 3 needs Task 2's client, etc.
